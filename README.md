This is the blue cloud project.
==============

hooray i finally made something that works almost completely

so this theme is basically what i did after i hated the green one's guts. it's blue and i used a color palette generator and it's awesome i love it hooray. also includes:

-center column posts<br>
-links tab in top-left; scrolls down on hover (is janky)<br>
-supercute green/yellow/blue colors aw yeah<br>
-has a weird ask page. can't figure out how to fix that. hmm :/<br>

hey if you're reading this i think you're cool and you deserve to be happy. go get yourself some happy, stretch. you earned it. by digging around in people's private files. snooping is cool. you're cool. eat a slice of cherry pie, you perpetrator.
